# Restaurant Template

## By Thomas Bockhorn - freelancer at Tecktonet.com

## Purpose:

<p>The purpose of this template is to show how Tecktonet can help you build the website you need to attain and maintain more clients.  Tecktonet will build a custom website based on what you need.</p>

## How this was built

<p>This particular template website was built with a laravel/PHP backend and a Vue front end.  Vue provides potential expandibility.  Vue allows users to keep their particular CMS.  Vue just needs to communicate with any particular CSM by using a RESTful API.</p>
<p>To make this SEO friendly, all I need to do is convert it to Nuxt to make it run on the server vs on the client's computer.</p>
